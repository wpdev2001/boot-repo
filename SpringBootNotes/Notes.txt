Dependencies management using Spring
In order to manage the dependencies we have to tell 3 important things to spring?

1. About the beans
--> Through @Components annotation(NOTE: we can use @Bean annotation which will be discussed later)
2. About dependencies
--> Through @Autowired annotation
3. Where to search the beans
--> use @ComponentScan() annotation

NOTE: The @SpringBootApplication tells that : "scan for the beans in the base package in which this particular annotation file is present. In our case it is com.wp"
OR if you want to scan for the beans in some other package then we use @ComponentScan(basePackages={"package1","package2",....})

Q] Suppose in our application we use @Component Annotation for more than one bean class then in that case, does the code will run?
--> No, And it will throw the following error!!!
Parameter 0 of constructor in com.wp.couple.Person required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- cat: defined in file [C:\Users\devadmin\SpringB_codes\03_beans-DependenciesMngt\target\classes\com\wp\couple\Cat.class]
	- dog: defined in file [C:\Users\devadmin\SpringB_codes\03_beans-DependenciesMngt\target\classes\com\wp\couple\Dog.class]

This may be due to missing parameter name information

Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed
-----------------------------------------------------

In case of having multiple beans with @Component annoatation and to resolve the ambiguity we use '@Primary' annotation to tell spring boot application that give it more priority.

Q] @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.wp","test"})  ??
--> The above annotation tell that to scan for both the packages in order to get the components and to resolve the bean.
